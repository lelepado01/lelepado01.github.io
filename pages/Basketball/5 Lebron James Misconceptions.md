# üèÄ Lebron James Misconceptions

*26/10/21*

## Finals Record

At this point the longevity argument is a bit overused, but it's still a valid point. Lebron has been to the finals 10 times, and has won 4 of them. 
Looking at it from this prospective, he's won 40% of the time. 
Are we sure we should penalize a player for making it to the finals? 
Would have been better if he lost in the first round?
Why is it that we think Allen Iverson's greatest accomplishment is making it to the finals, but Lebron's greatest failure is losing in the finals?
The same thing can be said about Jimmy Butler's finals run in 2020 and 2023. 

## He's not clutch

By now we should all know that Lebron is one of the most clutch players in NBA history.
He's hit game winners in the playoffs, and has a higher FG% in the playoffs than Kobe Bryant.
He's also hit more game winners than Kobe Bryant.
He's also hit more game winners than Michael Jordan.
He's also hit more game winners than Larry Bird.

## He Destroyes teams once he leaves

This is a weird one.
When the Bulls blew up their one and only championship core, it took them X years to get back to the playoffs, and they have yet to get back to the finals.
We have a sample size of three teams that Lebron has left by now. 
The cavs, the first time, managed to rebuild a competitive team around Kyrie Irving, so much so that he was compelled to return.
The heat took N years to get back to the playoffs, and have appeared in the finals twice, with a core of young players and a well-fitting free agent signing.
The cavs, the second time, have have made the playoffs in 2023, and they have a young core of players that are looking promising.

## 2011

## Defense

I understand he may not be the best defender in the league, but he's not a bad defender.
He also has a very unique skillset that allows him to guard 1-5, and he's done it in the playoffs.
Compared to Michael, he also offers some rim protection, and it showed in the finals against the Spurs and the Warriors.
